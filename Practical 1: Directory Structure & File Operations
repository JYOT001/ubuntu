Step 1: Create the Directory Structure
Run the following commands one by one (or paste them) to create the tree:
# Create directories ( -p creates parent directories automatically)
mkdir -p ~/Study/GNU/DCS/IT mkdir -p ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS 
mkdir -p ~/Study/GNU/Engineering/Computer 
mkdir -p ~/Study/GNU/Engineering/Civil
mkdir -p ~/Study/HNGU/BBA 
# Create the required files in the CS directory
touch ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS/DivA.txt 
touch ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS/DivB.txt
touch ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS/DivC.txt 
touch ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS/Sports 
touch ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS/Marksheet

Step 2: Perform the Operations
Operation A: Copy ALL Files of CS Directory to Engineering > Civil
cp ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS/* ~/Study/GNU/Engineering/Civil/

Operation B: Remove all Files of Civil with Interactive mode

# -i asks for confirmation before deleting rm -i ~/Study/GNU/Engineering/Civil/*
(Type 'y' and Enter for each file prompt)

Operation C: Move files starting with ‘S’ and ‘M’ from CS to Computer
mv ~/Study/GNU/DCS/CS/[SM]* ~/Study/GNU/Engineering/Computer/

Operation D: Set Engineering as PWD and Delete Directory Structure of Civil interactively
# Change directory (PWD means Present Working Directory) cd ~/Study/GNU/Engineering
# Delete Civil directory recursively (-r) and interactively (-i) rm -ri Civil
