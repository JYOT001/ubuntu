To give a normal user "Root" (Administrator) privileges, you usually add them to the sudo group.

Command:
# Syntax: sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> sudo usermod -aG sudo student

(Replace 'student' with the actual username)
Verify: Switch to that user and try running a root command (like sudo apt update).
