To let members of the Account group manage users (adduser, userdel, passwd), you must edit the sudoers file.

1. Open the sudo configuration: 
sudo visudo

2. Scroll to the bottom and add this line: 
%Account ALL=(ALL) /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/userdel, 
/usr/bin/passwd
(This allows anyone in the 'Account' group to run useradd, userdel, and passwd commands as root).

3. Save and Exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).
